#### How to to fluentd, elasticsearch and kibana to collect container log in K8S

To collect container logs in Kubernetes using Fluentd, Elasticsearch, and Kibana, you can follow these general steps:

1. Deploy Elasticsearch in your Kubernetes cluster using a StatefulSet. You can use the following YAML file as a starting point:

   `````yaml
   apiVersion: apps/v1
   kind: StatefulSet
   metadata:
     name: elasticsearch
   spec:
     serviceName: elasticsearch
     replicas: 3
     selector:
       matchLabels:
         app: elasticsearch
     template:
       metadata:
         labels:
           app: elasticsearch
       spec:
         containers:
         - name: elasticsearch
           image: docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:7.14.0
           ports:
           - containerPort: 9200
             name: rest
             protocol: TCP
           - containerPort: 9300
             name: inter-node
             protocol: TCP
           env:
           - name: cluster.name
             value: my-cluster
           - name: node.name
             valueFrom:
               fieldRef:
                 fieldPath: metadata.name
           - name: discovery.seed_hosts
             value: "elasticsearch-0.elasticsearch,elasticsearch-1.elasticsearch,elasticsearch-2.elasticsearch"
           - name: cluster.initial_master_nodes
             value: "elasticsearch-0,elasticsearch-1,elasticsearch-2"
   ```

   This YAML file creates a StatefulSet with three replicas of the Elasticsearch container. The container runs version 7.14.0 of the Elasticsearch image. The container is configured with a few environment variables that specify the name of the Elasticsearch cluster and the names of the initial master nodes.

2. Deploy Kibana in your Kubernetes cluster using a Deployment. You can use the following YAML file as a starting point:

   ````yaml
   apiVersion: apps/v1
   kind: Deployment
   metadata:
     name: kibana
   spec:
     selector:
       matchLabels:
         app: kibana
     replicas: 1
     template:
       metadata:
         labels:
           app: kibana
       spec:
         containers:
         - name: kibana
           image: docker.elastic.co/kibana/kibana:7.14.0
           ports:
           - containerPort: 5601
             name: http
             protocol: TCP
           env:
           - name: ELASTICSEARCH_URL
             value: http://elasticsearch:9200
   ```

   This YAML file creates a Deployment with one replica of the Kibana container. The container runs version 7.14.0 of the Kibana image. The container is configured with an environment variable that specifies the URL of the Elasticsearch cluster.

3. Deploy Fluentd in your Kubernetes cluster using a DaemonSet. You can use the following YAML file as a starting point:

   ````yaml
   apiVersion: apps/v1
   kind: DaemonSet
   metadata:
     name: fluentd
   spec:
     selector:
       matchLabels:
         app: fluentd
     template:
       metadata:
         labels:
           app: fluentd
       spec:
         containers:
         - name: fluentd
           image: fluent/fluentd:v1.13-1
           env:
           - name: FLUENT_UID
             value: "0"
           volumeMounts:
           - name: varlog
             mountPath: /var/log
           - name: varlibdockercontainers
             mountPath: /var/lib/docker/containers
             readOnly: true
           - name: fluentd-config
             mountPath: /fluentd/etc/fluent.conf
             subPath: fluent.conf
         volumes:
         - name: varlog
           hostPath:
             path: /var/log
         - name: varlibdockercontainers
           hostPath:
             path: /var/lib/docker/containers
         - name: fluentd-config
           configMap:
             name: fluentd-config
   ```

   This YAML file creates a DaemonSet with one instance of the Fluentd container running on each node in the Kubernetes cluster. The container runs the Fluentd image from the Docker Hub. The container is configured with a few environment variables that specify the Fluentd UID and the location of the container logs. The container also mounts a few volumes that contain the container logs and the Fluentd configuration file.

4. Create a ConfigMap with the Fluentd configuration file. You can use the following YAML file as a starting point:

   ````yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: ConfigMap
   metadata:
     name: fluentd-config
   data:
     fluent.conf: |
       <source>
         @type tail
         path /var/log/containers/*.log
         pos_file /var/log/es-containers.log.pos
         tag kubernetes.*
         read_from_head true
         <parse>
           @type json
           time_format %Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%NZ
         </parse>
       </source>
       <match kubernetes.**>
         @type elasticsearch
         hosts elasticsearch:9200
         logstash_format true
         include_tag_key true
         tag_key kubernetes.tag
         flush_interval 1s
       </match>
   ```

   This YAML file creates a ConfigMap with the Fluentd configuration file. The configuration file specifies a tail source that reads container logs from the `/var/log/containers` directory. The configuration file also specifies an Elasticsearch match that sends the container logs to the Elasticsearch cluster.

5. Apply the Elasticsearch, Kibana, Fluentd, and ConfigMap YAML files to your Kubernetes cluster using the following commands:

   ````bash
   kubectl apply -f elasticsearch-statefulset.yaml
   kubectl apply -f kibana-deployment.yaml
   kubectl apply -f fluentd-daemonset.yaml
   kubectl apply -f fluentd-configmap.yaml
   ```

   This will create the Elasticsearch StatefulSet, Kibana Deployment, Fluentd DaemonSet, and ConfigMap in your Kubernetes cluster.

That's it! You have now deployed Fluentd, Elasticsearch, and Kibana in your Kubernetes cluster to collect container logs. You can access the Kibana web interface by navigating to `http://<kibana-service-ip>:5601` in your web browser, where `<kibana-service-ip>` is the IP address of the Kibana Service. From there, you can create visualizations and dashboards to analyze your container logs.

#### What are some common issues I might encounter when deploying this stack?

When deploying the Fluentd, Elasticsearch, and Kibana (EFK) stack to collect container logs in Kubernetes, there are several common issues you might encounter. Here are some examples:

1. Resource allocation: Fluentd, Elasticsearch, and Kibana all require significant amounts of memory and CPU resources. If you don't allocate enough resources to these components, you might experience performance problems or crashes. Make sure to monitor the resource usage of each component and adjust the resource allocation as necessary.

2. Network connectivity: Fluentd needs to be able to connect to the Kubernetes API server to collect container log data, and it needs to be able to connect to Elasticsearch to send the log data. If there are network connectivity issues between these components, Fluentd might not be able to collect or send the log data.

3. Configuration errors: There are many configuration options for Fluentd, Elasticsearch, and Kibana, and it's easy to make mistakes when configuring these components. Make sure to carefully review the configuration files and double-check all settings before deploying the stack.

4. Version compatibility: Fluentd, Elasticsearch, and Kibana all have different versions, and it's important to ensure that the versions you are using are compatible with each other. Incompatible versions can cause unexpected errors or data loss.

5. Storage capacity: Elasticsearch requires a significant amount of storage capacity to store log data, and it's easy to run out of storage if you don't monitor usage carefully. Make sure to monitor the storage usage of Elasticsearch and adjust the storage allocation as necessary.

6. Security: The EFK stack can contain sensitive data, so it's important to ensure that the components are secured properly. Make sure to implement appropriate security measures, such as encrypting data in transit and at rest, using secure authentication mechanisms, and limiting access to the components.

7. Performance tuning: Depending on the size of your Kubernetes cluster and the volume of log data you're collecting, you might need to tune the performance of the EFK components. This might involve adjusting buffer sizes, increasing parallelism, or other performance optimizations.

These are some of the common issues you might encounter when deploying the EFK stack in Kubernetes. Make sure to monitor the components closely and address any issues as they arise to ensure a stable and reliable log collection system.
